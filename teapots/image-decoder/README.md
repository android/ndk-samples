# image-decoder

This sample demonstrates the
[ImageDecoder](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/image-decoder)
functionality added to Android 11:

- Texture files are decoded with AImageDecoder
- The rest of the code is the same as that of TexturedTeapot This sample needs
  to be build with NDK 21.1 available from the canary channel, Android Studio
  4.0+ would prompt you to install the needed NDK; in case you meet
  difficulties, check out
  [NDK configuration documentation](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/wiki/Configure-NDK-Path)
  to fix local issues.
