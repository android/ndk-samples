gles3jni
=========
gles3jni is an Android C++ sample that demonstrates how to use OpenGL ES 3.0 from JNI/native code.

The OpenGL ES 3.0 rendering path uses a few new features compared to the
OpenGL ES 2.0 path:
- Instanced rendering and vertex attribute divisor to reduce the number of
  draw calls and uniform changes.
- Vertex array objects to reduce the number of calls required to set up
  vertex attribute state on each frame.
- Explicit assignment of attribute locations, eliminating the need to query
  assignments.
