prefab-dependency
==================

C/C++ dependencies are C/C++ libraries packed with [Prefab] format into an AAR.
This sample shows how to import [JsonCPP] AAR, one example of [C/C++ dependencies], from Google Maven to an Android project.

[Prefab] could be enabled from Android Gradle Plugin 4.0+. In roder to use the feature, follow these 3 steps:

* Enable the prefab feature in [gradle.properties]. **Note** that in 4.1+, this needs to be
  done with `android.buildFeatures.prefab=true` in the application's build.gradle file.
* Declare the dependencies in the app module's [build.gradle] in the same way you as would do with Kotlin/Java
  dependencies.
* Add the dependencies into the native module's [Android.mk] or [CMakeLists.txt]

From here on, the [headers] and [libraries] in the dependencies are available for your native build system!

If you want to understand more about C/C++ dependency AARs, go to [C/C++ dependencies] page for 
Android Prefab official documentation.

Pre-requisites
--------------

* Android Gradle Plugin 4.0+
* The [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/).

Getting Started
---------------

The C++ code in this sample can be built with either CMake (the default for this
project) or ndk-build. To use ndk-build set the `ndkBuild` project property
either in your `local.properties` file or on the command line by passing the
`-PndkBuild` flag when building.

To build with [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html):

1. Open this project in Android Studio.
2. Click *Run/Run 'app'*.  If you want to debug/trace code, due to [the SSL lib's known issue with lldb](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/issues/740), make sure to apply the recommendations there for a smooth debugging experience.

To build from the command line:

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Run `./gradlew installDebug` (or `gradlew.bat installDebug` on Windows).

CA Certificates
----------------

As explained by [this Stack Overflow
post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30430033/632035), the root certificates
presented by Android since ICS are not in the format OpenSSL expects, so we need
to provide our own certificate file. We do this by downloading curl's cacert.pem
and storing that in our assets directory, as described in [this Stack Overflow
post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31521185/632035).
