Prefab Samples
==============
The samples in this directory demonstrate how to create and consume [C/C++
dependencies] with the Android Gradle Plugin. Dependencies are packaged within
AARs using the [Prefab] package format. The Android Gradle Plugin natively
supports producing and consuming these, so you do not need to worry about the
details of the packaging format.

The individual samples will explain in more detail, but the typical workflow for
a consumer of a native dependency is:

1. Enable the prefab build feature in your `build.gradle` file.
1. Add the dependency to the dependencies block of your `build.gradle` file.
1. Import the package in your `CMakeLists.txt` or `Android.mk` file.
1. Link the dependencies to your libraries.

Linking the dependency to your library will automatically make the headers
available, link the required libraries, and include the dependencies you use in
your application or library.

To produce an AAR that exposes C/C++ APIs:

1. Enable the `prefabPublishing` build feature in your `build.gradle` file.
1. Use `android.prefab` in your `build.gradle` file to declare the names of the
libraries you wish to export and the headers that define their interface.

To test your packages, follow the steps for package consumers. Note that until
https://issuetracker.google.com/120166563 is fixed it is not possible to depend
on the native components of an AAR generated by another module of the same
project when using Android Studio. Instead, test in a separate project. You can
import the AAR into your test project either [directly](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library#AddDependency)
or by publishing it to a Maven repository.

With that in mind, the samples here collectively demonstrate prefab usage:

* prefab-publishing shows how to create an AAR for distributing native libraries
* prefab-dependency shows how to import native dependencies from [GMaven]
* curl-ssl: for shows to use 2 very specific and important AARs (curl and ssl)

Prefab Availability
-------------------

Support for Prefab packages has been available Android Gradle Plugin since version 4.0:
* Consuming native dependencies requires AGP 4.0+
* Generating AARs that export native dependencies requires AGP 4.1+

The AARs used by the samples here are hosted at [Google Maven], but you can
host your AARs anywhere accessible to gradle.

[Google Maven]: https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#com.android.ndk.thirdparty

Pre-requisites
--------------

* Android Gradle Plugin 4.0+
* The [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/)

Please check for the individial sample's README.md for anything specific to that sample.
