# curl-ssl

This sample shows how to import [curl] and [OpenSSL] from Google Maven to
display a list of the most recent 10 reviews submitted to AOSP's code review
system.

One of the goals is demonstrate how to handle HTTPS certificates correctly as
explained by
[this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30430033/632035): the
root certificates presented by Android since ICS are not in the format OpenSSL
expects, so we need to provide our own certificate file. We do this by
downloading curl's cacert.pem and storing that in our assets directory, as
described in
[this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31521185/632035).

If you want to understand how to use C/C++ dependencies with AGP, refer to:

- [prefab-dependency] and [prefab-publishing] samples in the same directory as
  this one
- [C/C++ dependencies] page for Android documentation for C/C++ dependencies

## Pre-requisites

- Android Gradle Plugin 4.0+
- The [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/).

## Getting Started

The C++ code in this sample can be built with either CMake (the default for this
project) or ndk-build. To use ndk-build set the `ndkBuild` project property
either in your `local.properties` file or on the command line by passing the
`-PndkBuild` flag when building.

To build with [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html):

1. Open this project in Android Studio.
1. Click *Run/Run 'app'*. If you want to debug/trace code, due to
   [the SSL lib's known issue with lldb](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/issues/740),
   make sure to apply the recommendations there for a smooth debugging
   experience.

To build from the command line:

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
1. Run `./gradlew installDebug` (or `gradlew.bat installDebug` on Windows).
