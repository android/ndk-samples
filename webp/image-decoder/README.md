# WEBP image-decoder
The sample demonstrates how to use the new AImageDecoder animated decoding API,
added in Android 12. The animated images such as webp, avif or other formats, are
decoded and copied into the native window to display them on the screen.

The goal of the sample is to collect feedback for new AImageDecoder API added in Android 12
and Android 11, please try it out and let us know your thoughts!

## Pre-requistites
- Android Gradle Plugin 4.1.2
- Platform SDK and NDK for Android 12
- An Android device running Android 12(API level 31)

## Getting Start
- build the sample and run it on an Android 12 device
- swap in new image files: drop them into src/main/assets/images, and add to imageFiles[] in image_viewer.cpp

## Support
Android 12, AImageDecoder API and this sample are at developer preview stage, you
may expect changes in the future Android 12 release cycles. If you find any error
or have any feedback, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk/issues/new).
Comments and patches are highly very welcome too!
