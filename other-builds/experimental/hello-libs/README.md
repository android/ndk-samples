Hello-libs
=========
Hello-Libs is an Android sample that demos native lib management in Android Studio.

This sample uses the new [Gradle Experimental Android plugin](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental) with external lib support:  
*    Build JUST a native shared library[for distribution]
*    Use 3rd party shared library / Static library   

The key points are:
*    Inform Android Studio where lib/header is
*    Add lib dependency to application	
Details are inside projects' build.gradle files

Sample content:
*    Create 2 shared libs[on terminal, execute "gradlew :gmath:distributeLib :gperf:distributeLib"]
*    Copy built libs into distribution directory
*    Create one application to use libs from the given distribution directory
