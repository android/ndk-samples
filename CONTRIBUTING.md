# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

- If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own
  the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an
  [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
- If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
  then you'll need to sign a
  [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

## Contributing a Patch

   details above).

1. The repo owner will review your request. If it is approved, the change will

   useful comments.
