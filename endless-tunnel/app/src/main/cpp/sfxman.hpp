/* Sound effect manager. This class is a singleton that manages sound effect
 * playback. Sound effects are defined by recipes (which are strings) that
 * indicate frequencies and durations. See the PlayTone() method for more info.
 * Note: our sfx generation code is very simplistic and lacks a mixer, so
 * only one sound can be playing at any given time. This is not a problematic
 * limitation for this simple sample but, needless to say, doesn't scale well
 * to a more complex game. */

   * more tones. Tones are separated by periods ('.'):
   *
   *    "<tone1>.<tone2>.<tone3>."
   *
   * Also, there must be a period at the end of the string.
   *
   * Each tone consists of settings separated by spaces. The order of settings
   * is irrelevant. Possible settings are:
   *     f<freq>  set frequency to <freq> Hz. 0 means noise.
   *     d<dur>   set duration to <dur> milliseconds.
   *     a<amp>   set amplitude to <amp> percent (0-100)
   *
   * Example: "d100 f300. d50 f250. a0 d100. a100 d50 f0."
   * This will play a 300Hz tone for 100ms, followed by a 250Hz tone
   * for 50 milliseconds, followed by 100ms of silence, followed
   * by 50 milliseconds of loud random noise. */
