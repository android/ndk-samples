# display-p3 ImageView Sample

A sample to view Display P3 images on Android devices. If Android OS and device
both support display P3 mode, two versions of the image will be displayed:

- Display P3 view on the left hand side
- sRGB view on the right hand side

## Pre-requisites

- [Android Oreo](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/index.html)
  (API level >= 26) device that supports wide color gamut mode (Implemented on
  Android Oreo with Display P3 color space)
- Android Studio 3.5.2+
- Android [NDK-r20+](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html)

## Getting Started

1. Enable "Natural" mode for "Color" configuration: Settings > Display > Colors
1. [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
1. [Download Android NDK-r15+](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html)
1. [Download source code](http://www.github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk)
1. Launch Android Studio.
1. "File"-->"New" --> "Import Project", select display-p3/build.gradle
1. "Run" --> "Run 'app'"

## Description

This sample creates
[Display P3](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0.html#cm)
EGLContext\_, then creates 2 textures for each PNG file under "assets" folder,
and on Android devices support Display P3:

- the first is in Display P3 image mode,
- the second is in sRGB mode. The sRGB texture is created by transforming the
  original Display P3 image into CIExyz 1931 color space, clamping colors in
  sRGB color space, then transforming it back to Display P3 color space to
  display.

For Android Devices that does NOT support display P3, both textures will be in
sRGB (identical view)

The Display P3 mode is turned on when application requests a window surface of
type `EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_EXT`:

```java
  std::vector<EGLint> attributes;
  attributes.push_back(EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_KHR);
  attributes.push_back(EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_EXT);
  attributes.push_back(EGL_NONE);
  engine->surface_ = eglCreateWindowSurface(
      engine->display_, config, engine->app->window, attributes.data());

```

Android 10+ supports EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_PASSTHROUGH_EXT, the sample
detects the extension and enables it instead of
EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_EXT. The difference between the two is on how to
handle OETF/EOTF ( gamma like thing):

- EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_PASSTHROUGH_EXT tells hardware to bypass
  OETF/EOTF transfer functions
- EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_EXT enables transfer functions when writing to
  framebuffers. Note that the implementation on Android 8 and Android 9 for
  EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_DISPLAY_P3_EXT may varies on your test devices, if you see
  the color washing out or too dark, you could change the code to alter
  OETF/EOTF functionality and texture's setting to get a correct setting fit
  your system.

All images under the assets folder are *assumed* to be already encoded in
Display P3 color space:

- gamma value : 2.2
- Display P3 color space with D65 as white reference point

To add new images, simply drop the new file into this folder. Please note that
all decompressing is performed on CPU at the start up time: it takes time when
there are lot of image files.

Some of the images are from
[codelogic's wide-gamut-tests](https://github.com/codelogic/wide-gamut-tests)
repo. On Display P3 capable devices, details inside red and green areas are
noticeably different, blue area is almost the same, just as expected.

Changing display mode:

- Tap on image to show/hide (Display P3 mode or sRGB mode)
- Swipe up/down to rotate through image files
